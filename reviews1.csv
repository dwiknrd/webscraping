"March 17, 2020",50,It's not noisy,"It may sound noisy initially but if you find a good place at the bar, the noises fade away and you can enjoy the company of your partner. One of the best Hard Rock Cafes one finds anywhere in the world."
"March 13, 2020",40,Good burger and unique atmosphere,"I had a very good burger here. The atmosphere is unique but do not expect hard rock music, there were more rap and pop video clips than rock."

"February 12, 2020",50,Last drinks before home,This is a great hard rock I've never been to a bad 1 in any country but this is 1 of my favourites so far great surroundings and the staff are brilliant
"January 31, 2020",40,Nice meal,"We booked online beforehand as I went a few years ago and there was quite a wait for walk ins. Food was nice, nothing to boast about but yummy. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. Reasonably priced. Would go again."
"January 11, 2020",40,Very Good,"Not dissapionted at all. It does what it says. Very nice food, drinks & service. We were very well looked after by our server & this is what we have grown to expect from Hard Rock."
"January 9, 2020",40,Lunch before 3PM performance with our grandson. New Yorkers who had never been to the Hard Rock in NY and delighted.,"We all had the Legendary Burger and it was delicious. Service was friendly and very good. Seating comfortable. Big place but we didn't feel closed in. Novel experience and priced well and according to our grandson, best burger sauce ever!"
"January 3, 2020",50,Christmas break in new york,"Had dinner in here with my daughter and granddaughter. Was very very busy but the food was fast, perfectly cooked and plentiful. The drinks also very tasty."
"December 31, 2019",50,Very good,"you have to go in time to get a table but it's worth it, the special hamburger is delicious as well as the tortillas with dissolved cheese and a very good attention"
"December 30, 2019",40,Amazing ribs!,"A very good meal of fajitas, ribs and salads. The only issue was the dressing missed from all three salads but it was put right quickly. Good service. The ribs were amazing. Really enjoyed."
"December 29, 2019",50,American breakfast in the heart of Times Square,"Quick, easy, friendly service. Easy place to get a traditional American breakfast if staying in the Times Square area"
"December 29, 2019",20,Disappointing,"I've been to lots of Hard Rock Cafes round the world and this was the most disappointing. The service was pretty poor, the burgers were really small and the whole experience was simply disappointing. I'd recommend going to Hard Rock Cafe just not this one."
"December 26, 2019",50,Christmas visit,Really friendly staff. Food was well nice and place was nice and clean. Hardly any wait time (we did book a table) very good value for money.
"December 12, 2019",50,Excellent place to visit.,Excellent place to visit. Fun atmosphere. Food good and waiter superb giving us chance to chose our own music. Recommend the vegetable fajitas
"December 11, 2019",10,Terrible!!!!,"Rude bar attendant. Felt very rushed, waitress seemed to constantly glare at us! Cold food. We have been to many hard rock cafes around the globe and this is by far the worst experience we had!!!"
"December 5, 2019",10,Awful place!,What an overrated venue! The staff were horrible! Abrupt and unpleasant. Food was ok if you like spending over the odds for cold food that tastes like it’s straight out of the microwave! Best part was when we left the building!
"November 30, 2019",40,Take Away and Souvenirs,Place was fully packed. We end up ordering our fave take away instead. That is the classic cheeseburger. Of course we didn’t miss out on our t shirt souvenirs.
"November 24, 2019",50,Great venue and restaurant,We attended the first Hard Rock Cafe gala for Teachrock and Steven Van Zandt. Great staff! We had an excellent time at our VIP table and it was a wonderful night to remember.
"November 18, 2019",40,Breakfast,Ate breakfast buffet with daughter while in new York very good selection juices tea coffee yogurts bagels cereal and hot selections 20 dollars each was worth it.
