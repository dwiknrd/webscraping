mistermark8,5.0," February 21, 2021","smaller than the US counterparts, great experience, and good food.","Love USJ! There's something they do different than other parks. All the staff is very kind and the merchandise is quite unique to this location. Recommend for friends, family, and must ride the dinosaur coaster.",Universal Studios Japan
Thea,5.0," December 7, 2020",Great Place!,"We went to USJ without purchasing any tickets beforehand, it took us less than 5 mins to purchase tickets. We went last Oct 2019 (not 2020), it was Halloween season. The theme of the place was halloween inspired. The lights, decorations, even Hello Kitty was dressed in a sppoky outfit, at night zombies will chase you,  Side note: Don't bring outside food because our food got confiscated at the entrance :(",Universal Studios Japan
Lisa,4.0," November 18, 2020",Once is e ought.,"I buy the annual pass each year and I wonder why. You go 3 times, it becomes cost effective. I never want to go more than that in one year.",Universal Studios Japan
jovinnnnn,5.0," November 18, 2020",Express Pass Recommended,"We bought our tickets through KKday for easy access via QRCode E-Ticket while we purchased our Express Passes direct from USJ's website as it was cheaper compared to packages sold from agencies. However, do note that the whole web page is in Japanese and would require and account and translation to complete the transaction.  Definitely a whole day or two would be required to complete all the attractions in the park with an express pass. We were in the park from opening till closing and although we purchased the Express 7, we did not get to complete 4-5 main attractions due to the queue.  We queued 90-105min for The Flying Dinosaur hence, it would be best to plan accordingly to fully utilized the time spent. Main attractions to visit would be The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, Minion Park and Hollywood the Ride! Terminator 2 3-D attraction was presented in Japanese only to our dismay hence, we got bored halfway through it.  Would definitely come back again to experience Super Nintendo World in 2021! :D",Universal Studios Japan
The Eating Ashman,4.0," November 1, 2020",Super full day at Universal Studios Japan osaka,"This was for my sons 10th birthday and my wife is also a pretty big Harry Potter fan. So the The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was the main reason that we went but there was plenty of other things to do and see. The rides we enjoyed were: Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey and Flight of the Hippogriff and Jurassic Park the ride (the last 2 were actual roller coaster rides, the other were 3D/4D rides). All of there were lots of fun but I prefer the actual rides to the 3D/4D rides. Make sure you get some Butterbeer - it tastes awesome. Also another tip is to go early or late for lunch as there can be a bit of a wait (also depending on where you go it can be a little expensive) Over all a fun filled, exhausting day that the whole family enjoyed",Universal Studios Japan
Joel S,5.0," October 24, 2020",Way better than Tokyo Disney!,The experience was the best we have had at an park attraction. So many cool rides and Harry Potter was out of this world...I'd pay just if it was only that section.,Universal Studios Japan
Alfie,4.0," October 22, 2020",Theme park trip,I liked it here because of the sun at lost here. The Japanese have a great sense of humour and mischief. I felt very safe.,Universal Studios Japan
Mawar M.S,5.0," October 5, 2020",Unforgettable moments,All i have felt was great. Fantastic. So happy and highly recommended. All ride so amazing. Minions. Harry potter. Spiderman. Jaws. The Flying Dinosour is very best. All protocol for safety.. i love it very much. Oh ya.. i just knew.. that u cant use your tripod here.. The location is near to station. Many thing to do here. Unforgettable moments. Its good if just solo traveller here.,Universal Studios Japan
pierreinasia,1.0," August 5, 2020",They won't let you bring in water.,"Knowing how incredibly annoying japanese people can get when it comes to dumbly applying rules, I read them carefully in both English and Japanese the day before going to avoid any problem. Alas, they still managed to find something to nitpick about in my bag : my bottle of water, which apparently was oversized (no joke -,-). So they took it and thanks to them I got a heatstroke. I contacted the customer service but they don't care. Great. Never going there again.",Universal Studios Japan
GroovyM,5.0," July 13, 2020",Everyone was very Friendly,"We live in Kansai and were able to visit in July 2020 during the restricted entry for local residents. We went on a weekday and there were no lines or large crowds. Everyone of the USJ staff was very happy and friendly. It was remarkable and added to the fun experience. **TIP** Download the USJ app on Android or iPhone. The map feature is excellent, you can save favorites and there is real-time information about wait times for the attractions. The Harry Potter Journey was incredible. It did make me dizzy and nauseous afterwords however. Overall it was a very fun day and we were able to see/do everything we wanted in about 5 hours because there were no lines or wait times for any of the attractions or restaurants.",Universal Studios Japan
StripeyMiata,4.0," June 26, 2020","For our USA fans, they still have the JAWS ride","A great day out, lots of unique things you never seen in USA parks like Sesame Street, Peanuts & Hello Kitty",Universal Studios Japan
Glee Peters,5.0," June 3, 2020",Loved Every Corner of USJ,"My favorite part of my experience is the Harry Potter ride experience. but i think, every part that i visited i have enjoyed a lot. i got back being a kid again hahaha. Though you have to be hungry walking the entire area. it is worth all your time.",Universal Studios Japan
Kim Sumin,5.0," May 28, 2020",USJ is really fantastic!,"There are various zones such as Harry Poter, Minion, Spider-Man, Jaws and Jurassic Park, and there are so many rides available for various age groups. The most interesting ride for me was The Flying dinosaur, but the waiting line was really long, so I was sad. If you buy Express Pass, you don't have to line up, but it's expensive. Therefore, To wait less I recommend waiting in one person line even if you have a party. And I recommend you to go for popular attractions like Harry Potter first. It was so much fun that I wanted to go to osaka every time. If you go to Osaka, please go to Universal Studios:)",Universal Studios Japan
Unknown,5.0," May 6, 2020",So much fun,"I went there in the late Morning and i spent the whole day there as its fun. There are different sections for different ages like the harry potter rides , the minion rides etc.",Universal Studios Japan
Hawks2theSuperBowl,5.0," April 9, 2020","In between Hollywood and Orlando, but the lines are INSANE","We‚Äôre frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood.  As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn‚Äôt a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it‚Äôs definitely fun and a really smooth ride.  Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you‚Äôre a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long.  As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it‚Äôs different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you‚Äôre only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides. (10/2018)",Universal Studios Japan
Ken Ip,5.0," March 19, 2020",USJ is so much fun,"I've been to USJ three time with my family already. We just love this place! It's so much fun. Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more. Only downside of course are the long lines. Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four. So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day. That's why we have been here 3 different times!",Universal Studios Japan
Oliver Curtis,5.0," March 17, 2020",The best theme park ever üé¢üé¢üé¢,"The rides where great and the Spiderman ride is definitely good for anyone (adult or child ) great area for your kids and the Harry potter ride is a must do though make sure to pay extra for fast tracks on the jaws , Harry potter rides , Spiderman and jurrasic park because the queen's can get very long . The food is amazing serving western and Japanese food and definitely try the matcha ice cream but the best part is the parade but if you want to get to the subway station quicker and go to the gift shop miss out the last bit of the parade as it can get quite claustrophobic in the shop or subway.  This is the best theme park ever and a must do for Osaka",Universal Studios Japan
Dzulhilmi Zulkifli,5.0," March 9, 2020",Great to spend your day with family,"Your Osaka trip is not complete if you not coming to amazing place. Great rides, great game and movie. The environment is just like the movie!!",Universal Studios Japan
Dzulhilmi Zulkifli,5.0," March 9, 2020",Very fun and i am enjoying all the attractive ride,"i have been there last week. since i purchased 1day unlimited pas and express pass, i can enjoy almost all the games. i manage to enter Harry Potter ride 2 times!! Value for money. guys, if u really want to try harry potter game, please go the ASAP, when the gate is open",Universal Studios Japan
Jennifer T,5.0," March 6, 2020",Very fun place!,We really enjoyed our time here! We rode the Fying Dinosaur and other rides - harry potter and other 4D rides. Hope we can come back!,Universal Studios Japan
EmilChana,5.0," March 5, 2020",Simply A Must,"When considering going to Japan, you should put Osaka in the travel itineraries, and one full day to visit Universal Studios Japan. Especially if you or your kid is a Harry Potter fan.",Universal Studios Japan
LanZ,3.0," March 4, 2020",Did not get through a lot with our kids in wet weather. Ok visit.,"On a weekday, took almost 5 & 7 year olds, arriving at 11amish. Bought tix at gate (had trouble online) which was quick (5 mins) and left the park at 7pm. Regretted not buying the express passes (for 3/5 rides) as we spent 45 mins + waiting for most rides and zig zagged the park a fair bit to try catch events at the times they were on. Missed out on a fair bit even though we had a plan. It also began to rain from around 3pm and never stopped so the fireworks and parade were cancelled with nothing to replace either except for a few actors (maybe 6) dressed in colourful outfits standing in a line waving at visitors. This is completely underwhelming and needs improvement.  The Cool Japan shows/attractions had a decent area and close to park entry but we didn‚Äôt visit as we had other priorities for our kids age interest.  Harry Potter land is amazing and looks so magical. Didn‚Äôt have timed entry in mid March. A definite highlight even though our kids haven‚Äôt yet read or watched any. Magical Nights light show was great. The Wand Studies was a waste of time unless you have it to waste and was definitely a cheesy push to send people through the wand shop which looked amazing but wand prices were bananas at 50 a pop. Zipped through the castle due lack of time. Missed the ride due to long queue in rain and kids too small for roller coaster.  Kids loved the Water World performance  Sesame st 4D movie was great and the only movie we were able to catch due time/location  Minions and Spider-Man rides were excellent for all of us. Jurassic Park scared our almost 7 more than our younger kid as he hated the steep drop. Be prepared to get wet.  Disappointments: -Queues were long for non peak time & minimal or no entertainment offered. Some shows/rides had time consuming pre show/ride sections which were just average and need reviewing -It‚Äôs Japan so yes, Japanese is the language used but there is ample opportunity for spoken English or at least subtitles during all shows. -Not enough characters sighted in park. Only saw about 5/6 of the Sesame St characters in the Hollywood area (I think) and that‚Äôs it! For the whole 8 hours we were there. -Unlike Disneyland, staff do not give Universal Studio stickers out. You have to request them. Almost all have them so it‚Äôs crappy you have to ask. It‚Äôs also crappy that there are only a small selection. Disneyland nails this! and it helps keep the kids in queues a bit happier when they hand them out. -Retail merch here was noticeably more expensive than Disney Tokyo a year prior. I expect high prices but I drew the line here as I felt it was a joke. - a number of rides were closed for maintenance and then more due to the rain. - many things closed around 5 pm, too many! With the rain and this, I found the park quite boring and looked forward to leaving but decided to swing by Muppet land where we managed to get on 3 rides in one hour. This area is great for under 5s but in saying that our almost 7 enjoyed it too.  In summary: visited La Universal 10yrs ahi and that was great. This time, with kids, it was a good but a number of disappointments for what it cost (time & $) ,too many things closed, not as exciting or magical as Disney.",Universal Studios Japan
alfaro jimenez,5.0," March 3, 2020",thank god we were able to go here before they closed down,thank god we were able to go here before they closed down great timing. lines were not that long due to the corona virus. harry potter ride wasnt long .we were able to see the attack on titans. love the ride of the flying dinosaur even if the ride waiting time was 3 hours .,Universal Studios Japan
Alice,4.0," February 29, 2020",Great tour,"If you love theme park, we highly recommend to visit Universal Studios. The crowd is not as important as in Disneyland in Tokyo if even if it was during a weekend in the summer. The park is quite big so one whole day is the minimum, and Harry Potter should be the first attraction to be visited since it is quickly full. People are very helpful and the visitors are very polite (queues are always respected), which makes your day way more enjoyable.  Th√© only big problem we went through was when we booked through Tripadvisor that cancelled a few days before our weekend our tickets without explanations, we had to buy in a hurry a few days prior to our weekend.",Universal Studios Japan
Katrinus,5.0," February 28, 2020",Surely this is the happiest place on earth!,"We got the day and a half pass and only just got to see all we wanted during this crowd free virus affected period. I can‚Äôt ride because of injuries and can be pretty grumpy but the cheerfulness here is catching! I was waving to everyone before I even knew what I was doing and chatted to lots of lovely people in the well behaved queues. My family had an amazing time at this spotlessly clean, crazy organised fun park! Harry Potter fans will especially love the Wizarding World, the night illuminations this month were breathtaking. So glad I included this to balance out all the temple time I put my family through üòâ",Universal Studios Japan
Belle S,5.0," February 28, 2020",Just Like A Dream,My experience in this park is better than the original Universal Studios in Hollywood. The waiting lines are not crazy and the rides are so worth it. My favorite is Wizarding World of Harry Potter. It's like you literally stepped into the movie!,Universal Studios Japan
Vhalerie Lee,5.0," February 27, 2020",Wizarding World of Harry Potter,"Make sure to get an express pass ticket because there are long lines at Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and sometimes they only allow a certain group of people to come in here during peak hours even if you already have a ticket. The rides are also quite long so the express pass comes in handy",Universal Studios Japan
flora1602,5.0," February 21, 2020",SO MUCH FUN!!!,Went there on Monday. Booked tickets from the Klook app and got the special entry. Managed to go in 15 mins early than the others. my first ride was the Harry Potter ride! took a lot of pictures with less crowds in it. love the butter beer (Non alcoholic drink) will definitely go here again in the future!,Universal Studios Japan
Brenden O,3.0," February 20, 2020","You know, it has roller coasters...","We had fun. But it‚Äôs relatively small and oh by the way the shows are obviously in Japanese. So that leaves the rides and I have to say two of the roller coasters are outstanding.  The waits are outside standing  So you know, it was fun.",Universal Studios Japan
BillNabilah,5.0," February 19, 2020",So much FUN !,"Awesome ride especially Harry Potter ride, dinasour ride and Hollywood Dream ride. I went there during Holloween and joined their Holloween party until 12am. So fun and awesomeness is on another level. Also being chased by Zombies is no joke. I screamed and laughed so hard while trying to rescue myself. The memories is unforgettable and it cheers me up whenever I feel down.",Universal Studios Japan
Dds,5.0," February 16, 2020",Awesome! No regrets with the 1.5 days tix,"After in depth research/reviews, we bought tickets on a Monday for 1.5 days. Voila! we managed to cover everything even though it was absolutely crowded. And Fyi, 95% of the language either spoken by the staff or ride/show related were all in Japanese. Bits of Harry Potter were in English and oh thank God...‚ÄùSing‚Äù was in English and it was so much fun. Some staff do understand and speak basic English though I must say all of them were really very polite and looked very happy doing their job so that was very welcoming. But I must warn you guys about the intro to the Terminator attraction. The lady in red took too long, tried to get the crowd in the mood but it was 100% in Japanese so for us it came across as boring and never ending. The rest of the attractions were just like any other Universal Studios...amazing. Butter beer was a nice surprise. Toilets were pleasantly clean all day. There were different sized/priced storage lockers upfront which were convenient. If you‚Äôre planning to watch the final show, staff will go all out to keep the walkway/seating in check. You‚Äôd have to sit within the road/garden site so head there earlier if you want a good spot. Only the Express pass will get you a seat on the platform. The final Parade took quite some time to finish but worth the time, it was magical. I found the merchandise quite pricy then again everything in Japan is quite pricy.",Universal Studios Japan
Adam M,4.0," February 15, 2020",Cool looking park and attractions,Cool looking park and attractions. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Osaka. Just make sure you arrive early and plan your day. Expect long wait times no matter the time of year.,Universal Studios Japan
Nutharin,5.0," February 15, 2020",Royal studio pass,"We five intended to visit Univeral studio Japan on January 2nd. We knew that there would be very crowded so we would like to make sure that we could enjoy our rides without waiting very long.  We bought 5 Royal Studio Pass via Govoyagin website. Firstly we couldn‚Äôt book. So we sent an e-mail directly to them. They got back to us and asked for our airplane tickets and hotel confirmation. After that they sent us an e-mail with a link to book the pass. It was pre-paid. And when we checked in at our hotel, our 5 Royal Studio Pass wrist bands were there. Very professional.  These wrist bands gave us the most convenient way to enjoy USJ. We didn‚Äôt have to wait at all. There would be some rides that we had to go during the period of time and only one time for fast track such as Harry Potter,Minion etc. The rest we could go as many times as we wanted like a fast track eg. Jaws, Spider man etc.  Turkey legs were delicious here. We had a fun time.",Universal Studios Japan
KathrynWin,5.0," February 12, 2020",Never too young!!!,My husband and I are in our 50s and we thoroughly enjoyed universal studios. We managed to do most of the rides with no ill effects. Fabulous day out for any age. I would highly recommend the Harry Potter ride,Universal Studios Japan

Chun,5.0," February 10, 2020",So much fun!,"Having visited a couple other Universal Studios, I was a bit worried that this experience would be same old same old but it was not! We visited during Cool Japan and had so much fun. There are lots of adorable merchandise to browse and buy and the rides are a little more intense as compared to those in the United States. Sure everything is in Japanese but we already expected that. You can read the 'ride sypnosis' on USJ's website before going if it bothers you.  Tip: Get in line for the Attack on Titans 4D ride when the park opens. It's worth the wait and so popular they close the ride after lunch time. It was hands down the best ride in the park.",Universal Studios Japan
Single Mum Travels,4.0," February 9, 2020",Energetic feel,"This Univeral was great. We loved the food, rides, shows and atmosphere. We would come back here again in the future.",Universal Studios Japan
xAZAMBx,5.0," February 9, 2020","We went on WED and THURS (JAN 2020), very little crowd (and no Express Pass)","We bought tickets for 2 days (because we knew we will spend long time shopping and applying for tourist refund). 1st day was on 29th JAN 2020, and the next day 30th JAN. We got there at around 8:20 and 8:30 am and on both days we ended up quite close to the entrance when we arrived.  The park opened at 8:45 (eventhough it listed the to open at 9am). Since there was a ""Cool Japan"" event, our first priority was to ride the Attack on titan. Eventhough the queue listed at 45 mins, we got on the ride after about 20-25mins. It was a really cool indoor roller coaster ride with VR. This turned out to be the best decision because throughout the day the line for this were consistently 100-110mins. We went to Minion Meyham next with very little wait (20 mins) but it was really disappointing. Maybe more for kids. Minions Ray sliders was next and it was surprisingly good. Then we immidiately went for Harry potter ride and IT WAS AMAZING!!! This is the best ride I have ridden in awhile! The wait for this was about 45 mins (however we went in after 30 mins.) I noticed the listed wait times are often Over estimated. We did not go on the 2 roller coasters (Dinasour and Hollywood Dream) because we were more excited for the Harry Potter world. The ButterBeer is a MUST! we paid 650yen for it. Also, there is a line in HP world which seemed to lead nowhere....this is actually the line into the wand magic show. We went in and WE WERE PICKED TO GET A MAGIC WAND! WOW! However eventhough we won, the wand is NOT FREE and costs 4900 yen. With the wand you can go around the park and test your magic spells (like opening a locked door, lighting a fire lamp ect.) - gimicky if you ask me.  For lunch we ate at the 3 broomsticks - be warned, it was very expensive although very very delicious. I ordered the Sheperds pie - incredibly good! But the Fish and chips were salty! On the 2nd day we ate at The Dragon's Pearl - disappointing - Dont waste your money here!!! On both days we ate dinner at universal City walk mall (just outside Universal after we have exited the park). we ate pasta at Romaken (just beside matsumoto kiyoshi) - highly recommended and cheaper than eating inside USJ too.  Anyways, other rides we went on were Spiderman (really good), Terminator (just another 3-d show), Jaws( quite boring) and some kids rides (Elmos skateboard - which was surprisingly good, Flying Snoopy and Moopy's ballon). We went to ALmost all the shows, The SHrek 3-D and the Sing on Tour were really good! Water world (in Japanese so we did not understand) and BAckdraft were okay. I also enjoyed Monster's Rock and Roll show, but I have a feeling the japanese audiences did not - maybe because they sang mostly 80s english songs which I enjoyed very much!  But highlight of the trip was the light show at Harry potter world. This show is incredible and Not to be missed! The night parade was just okay - Pale in comparison with Disney's night parade.  The 2nd day we went on the Harry potter ride 3 MORE TIMES!!!! Yeah, we loved it that much! It was really impressive! And each time we did not was wait more than 20 minutes. Towards end of the day at around 6pm , we went on the ride again and had no wait at all because everybody were waiting at outside the castle to watch the light show. We also finished our shopping at around 4pm and at the time, the line for the tourist refund were really short!!! So, my advice is do your shopping early and get the tourist refund done early - as it gets really crowded at night.  We glad we came on wed and thurs. There were not many crowds at all. most rides had only 20-30 mins wait except the flying Dinosaur and hollywood dream and even that they were consistently 55-60 mins max everytime i checked. I saw some people buying express passes and cant help to think they just wasted their money on that day.",Universal Studios Japan
Damienofkent,5.0," February 9, 2020",The staff were so friendly & happy,"If I was rating just the park I would of given a 4 star but due to the staff all being fantastic it‚Äôs gone up to a 5  The actual park is not the biggest and several rides are very dated now and need changing eg .... Back draft ride ... I‚Äôm 40 and even I don‚Äôt remember when that film came out or what‚Äôs it was about .... apart from fire lol Terminator 2 ride was very slow and dragged , jaws classic ride can‚Äôt fault it , Spider-Man great , The pterodactyl ride in Jurassic Park was amazing and Harry Potter world didn‚Äôt disappoint  The late night parade was good and great effects  We went on Feb on a week day and the Qs were only half hr max so no issues there  Would recommend for a day out lots of fun and the staff were all fantastic",Universal Studios Japan
Mom Oh Moms,5.0," February 7, 2020",USJ trip,"Nice place to be there but there was so many people. If you intend to play, its best to buy the fast lane tickets so that you can enjoy it. I didn't have the time to enter bcos of so many people there & the queue was terrible.",Universal Studios Japan
Patrick O,5.0," February 7, 2020",Fun Place For Everyone!,"We visited on New Year's Eve and bought a pass for the day and the party that followed. The park is definitely similar to the US equivalents but a fun place to be and high quality! We went on the Jaws ride and it was fun. Of course it is all in Japanese but that is fine. After all you are in Japan. The Back Draft experience was fun for us but there is a lot of fire so if you have small children it may not be for you. Spiderman was very fun. Terminator 2 was okay but Spiderman is better if you have to make a choice. Sing the musical was okay but more so for kids. The Harry Potter ride was really fun but a lot of motion. My stomach was a little queasy but only for a short time. Great ride overall. Be sure that you understand whether the ride is open or not, We ignored a sign (or missed it) that said it was only a castle walk through and we waited in line a long time only to have no ride. We went later and it was outstanding! It would be nice if they had a fly over ride that had a big screen overview of Japan like California Disney has but alas, there is not one. Nice park and lots of good restaurant choices there as well. Expect Universal prices in the stores, but the restaurants were not overpriced as far as we were concerned. Of course we do not have children.",Universal Studios Japan
Patrick O,5.0," February 7, 2020",Fun Way To Spend New Year's!,"We bought a ticket to the park so we could go during the day for a bit and then we left when they closed the park for an hour and rentered with the party entry ticket. Fun to walk around and see all the decorations for Christmas. The live entertainment was fun to watch from a distance but we did not stand in that area for very long as we wanted to experience the park. It was cold and crowded, but we were dressed for it. I did buy a Jaws Hat and would have liked to have the royalties on the hats as they sold thousands of them! They do keep your head warm! It was crowded but we worked through the crowds and got on the rides that we wanted to. The Minions and Harry Potter was where the big crowds were. The fireworks were fun and it was great that the park was open all night! Overall we had a great time. We had my niece who is 27 so 3 adults. Glad we went in during the day and had fun at night! Only giitch was the tight crowd pushing and shoving toward Harry Potter when the fireworks were over. We enjoyed it!",Universal Studios Japan
JB Zarcal,5.0," February 4, 2020","The Best of 3 Worlds - East, West and Magic!","It's not just western movie themed. If you're lucky, you might encounter Anime-themed attractions (sadly seasonal). Check their website for anime special rides and plan accordingly. You'll definitely enjoy Harry Potter. In fact, I suggest you book for 2 days, 1 for just Harry Potter and another for the rest of Universal.",Universal Studios Japan
JJJ,4.0," February 1, 2020",Fabulous,"The first thing caught my eyes is the crystal festival. The field of Harry Potter is indeed sensational. But what impression last in my mind is the sense of humour that staffs have - little baby dinosaur in his unique babyseat and it's ""alive"" like his mum .......l mean ""vivid""! Very creative! Highly recommended!",Universal Studios Japan
Mike,1.0," January 28, 2020",Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money !,"Osaka USJ - shockingly poor value for money ! You will probably regret this.  We regrettably paid for express 4 passes & express 7 had sold out 15 mins into opening time. But It was a complete waste (with a one-day studio pass) of over $500AUD! For 2 anyway.  Let‚Äôs face it Japan is very crowded & due to this quite regimented. USJ has ineffective management & poor staff supervision, I saw none. The ride staff were actually quite rude often (I know right RUDE STAFF at a UNIVERSAL STUDIOS!) but it was far worse than just this, they were slow disengaged & unmotivated, this is totally unacceptable. I saw many groups of mostly young girl staff wandering around the park like they were guests, I mean with 70-120 min wait times for some rides & people queueing 30mins-45mins for a pretzel or churo‚Ä¶THIS IS SHOCKINGLY BAD!  USJ STAFF: YOUR JOB IS TO SERVE THE GUESTS AS FAST & FRIENDLY AS YOU CAN! Or be sacked!  I recommend Westerners to STAY AWAY! You won't like this. There is little value placed on your freedom here, it‚Äôs a real circus and not in a good way! park management obviously failing to put any reasonable limits on how many attendees they admit to the park. It was not a casual fun experience. It was like being marched around in a prison camp! All the above has a de-valuation effect in my opinion, damaging the historically great entertainment based name of Universal Studios USA  The food in the outlets, which could have saved them, absolutely did not! We had a burger at Mels Diner early before lunch - why would an attraction making such huge profits skimp on the food ‚Äì This was nothing like what you might get at a real American diner.  We turned to Alcohol (Extortion like prices) to cover up how we were feeling about how bad this was.  I recommend to Universal Studios America to undertake an assessment here, it‚Äôs no good if a foreign operator is wrecking your brand! Maybe bring is a consultant from the Singapore USS.  I‚Äôve been to all the Disney Parks in Japan multiple times & recommend you choose Disneyland & Disneysea Tokyo Bay ‚Äì its far superior to this atrocious greedy wrecking ball to western values. There is nothing fun about this claustrophobic regimented experience. UGH! Date of experience: January 2020",Universal Studios Japan
Sarah5677,5.0," January 27, 2020","Great for families, be prepared to walk and have fun","Went there early December, the lines were supposedly not as long as expected but it was cold.

QueenWanklin,5.0," January 26, 2020",Amazing entertainment for all ages!,"We regret not spending more than a day in USJ, as there were a lot to discover here that we were not able to. Highly recommended to go for 2 days the least, or buy an express pass so that you do not have to line up and spend a minimum of 1.5 hours in line with the best rides that they have here (Harry Potter, Minions, etc). Prices are just like the western universal studios, but hey, they will milk you out as much as possible, as expected. Money grabbing dudes as they even ask for more money to have the best seat in the parade, which actually you can avoid paying by just being there earlier. We enjoyed wasting our money here, so money well spent. ;-) Kids were ecstatic!",Universal Studios Japan
Joe M,5.0," January 23, 2020",number one must visit park,"I am proud to say I am happy I put visiting USJ as the activity for my first day in OSAKA. I bought the tickets online and got an e-ticket form (which ease me from printing and folding papers in my bag). My sister and I arrived in front of the gate by 08.50 using JR Haruka Limitted Express. (you can buy the JR 5 days pass in Klook with a good deal, i'll write about this in another page) Anyways, the queue was long for a low season day. (FRI 10 jan 2020) but we managed to get through the security bag check after 20 minutes. Visitors are not allowed to bring selfie sticks, they were asked to keep them in a locker. Once inside, we directly ran to the WWOHP. Oh yeah make sure you wear comfortable shoes for many walks. The WWOHP is less crowded in the morning and since we did not buy the express pass or Harry potter timed ticket pass (we just have the regular ticket and with great planning it is more than enough). We rushed to queue for the Forbidden Journey ride! Lucky us we only queue for 45 mins! This ride is a must, though we've played this in Hollywood, we play it one more time in Japan. Then after the ride, we took pictures and drink the famous butter beer. Japan offers hot butterbeer during cold seasons and this tastes better! When the visitors flooded the WWOHP area, we moved to Amityville and ride the one and only Jaws experience in Japan! This is fun even though we had no idea of the Japanese drama. Then we had lunch at Three broomsticks around 11.45 and it's starting to get full, but we found a nice spot outside. Lunch was magical with the Hogwarts Castle view. I got a nice shot from the outdoor area. Then to digest our food, we do the Harry Potter castle walk. Afterwards, we queue for the (must ride) Pterodactyls in the Jurasic world. Then there's the amazing spiderman ride which is suitable for all age. We skipped all of the shows for we've seen a lot of them in the other Universal Studios. Sadly one of the big ride (the one rollercoaster which were pulled backwards) were under maintenance and we cannot ride it. We did not wait for the parade at night, for we have another itinerary waiting, but by 16.00 we've bought our last souvenirs and say goodbye to USJ. Skipped minion and all the shows for kids. We took a lot of pictures and enjoyed more of the vibes there! The regular tickets works best when you planned everything well. See you another day USJ! Meet sanrio characters and other famous characters Gotta say Japan has a lot of characters posing for pictures. We met all of elmo's friends, minions and gru, and of course Hello kitty and marilyn monroe. The employees are super nice and kind, they won't hesitate taking pics for you! Visit Olivander's wand shop in the morning, before the lines are long.  There's a lot of restaurants and cafes in front of the gate. Just outside the train station and before the USJ main gate. If you use JR pass, stop at Universal City station, once you get off just walk to the left and voila you're there!",Universal Studios Japan

Patrick Simandjuntak,4.0," January 20, 2020",Fun and Friendly Staff,"This is second visit to Universal Studios Japan because of 'Harry Potter'. Bought the Universal Express Pass Package which was quite expensive to avoid the approximately 2 hours queuing for several attraction/rides. The restaurants good food, especially the Finnegan Bar & Grill.",Universal Studios Japan
researching next holiday,3.0," January 19, 2020",not great value for money,"As a family with 2 teenagers, we visited USJ. While we got the 15 minute early entry, we were done just after 2pm. There are about 4 main rides and Harry Potter world. There is no much after that. For the price that we paid for the tickets, I did not find this to be good value.",Universal Studios Japan
Rachelwalker12,5.0," January 18, 2020",Incredibly friendly staff!!,"We had a super fun day exploring the park, and found the staff so so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic. We treated ourselves to an express pass which was very expensive but it was nice to skip the queue on a few key rides. Not sure you‚Äôd need it In low season though.",Universal Studios Japan
Angie01052015,5.0," January 17, 2020",Lots of fun,"Our 11 and 8 year olds picked this cos of Harry Porter and it was worth it. I personally am not a roller coaster fan but by the end of the one day, I must admit it was lots of fun. Plenty of screams and adventures and would advise the purchase of express pass unless you have lots of time to sit in the queues",Universal Studios Japan
Mantas D,4.0," January 16, 2020",Mixed opinions,"Let's start that this park is quite different from the one I visited in Orlando, Florida. There are some rides built only there and some are missing. Especially the ride on the pterodactyl tail. The local ride, Attack on Titans, unfortunately, was closed and we couldn't do it. There is another huge ride which is closed as well. First tip: get to the park from Monday to Thursday. Check if no holidays are happening in country. This will save you from overcrowding. Huge tip: should you plan not to get express pass I highly recommend choosing to go via solo lanes. Way faster, ignores 2 hour waiting time. The only negative is the one cannot sit next to their friends/family. It is possible to ask at the ride if they have solo queues or check on booklets (found on internet or handed out at the entrance). As a result, we manneged to do almost all major rides without waiting ages. How to get there? There is a designated JR train connected to main train lines of Osaka. In stations there are various signs indicating which station to take. Don't worry to ask staff, very helpful and resourceful. From Nararel hostel it took us 30mins to get there. The only drawback of the park are prices. Some prices of the place are skyrocketing. The wands start from 4200 yens which is more then a half of ticket. Food is fresh and decent, no complaints here. Almost forgot, terminator 3d show is my personal sleeper. Even if you don't understand Japanese it is rather easy to follow the action. I have never seen that footage with original actors from the franchise. Well worth for anyone. In sum, it was a well spent time full of surprises, great March, tears and 3 rides on HP castle. Despite high prices and sometimes overcrowded days, I highly recommend this park for a visit for families, couples or solo travellers",Universal Studios Japan

Ana,3.0," January 16, 2020",Extremely expensive for not a lot of rides,At $800 (Australian) I expected more rides. We paid for the express pass 4 and in total used 11 rides / shows over 8 hours. A lot of the shows like Jaws and Backdraft were in Japanese so pretty much a waste of time. This was all the rides possible (other than very young kiddie rides) and included the Flying Dinosaur twice. We have kids aged 10 and 12. They loved it but we felt ripped off. The food was outrageously priced - we spent $55 (!) on popcorn which included a plastic minion holder ($45 with popcorn plus one refill an extra $10) one ice cream sundae ($12) looked big enough for two to share but was a small cup inside a large bucket to trick you into thinking it had more in it. All in all left starving and feeling ripped off.,Universal Studios Japan
nessyd,4.0," January 16, 2020",Didn‚Äôt need Express pass in witner,We didn‚Äôt mind waiting for the rides as the queues weren‚Äôt too bad. The best rides were the Harry Potter school and the Jurassic park flying roller coaster. Waterworld show was awesome but Backdraft was not worth the wait. Wish we‚Äôd seen the little Japanese restaurant near San Fransisco instead of all the cheap fast food options. We left on a high! Such a great day!,Universal Studios Japan

sportsjunkie,3.0," January 11, 2020",Don't go during Holidays,"We went there on New Year's day & it was not a wise choice.  The park itself is OK - good layout, accessible, good variety of rides and entertainment. But we didn't get to fully appreciate it because of the thick crowd, long queue and limited operation hours.  Go on off-peak, never during Holidays.",Universal Studios Japan
Melsa85,3.0," January 9, 2020",Definitely get an express pass and visit in off oeak,"We were there at 8:30am and the lines were okay for an off peak day. The problem was that unlike Singapore, they bag check everyone. So once the doors opened, it was another 30mins to get in. Unfortunately the Hollywood section was closed which was really disappointing. The lines were insane - even on an off peak day when the park was at 15% capacity lines were still over an hour. We had a fast pass 4 and that was worth it, the rides we used it on had 60-70min lines and we lined up for less than 10mins each time.  There are minimal places to sit down around the park and I got told off quite a few times by staff for sitting on a garden bed edge or on a curb due to the lack of seating. I have an injury so the lack of seating was a real issue for me.  Be aware everything is in Japanese - none of the rides or 3D sections have any English parts. This means terminator, Harry Potter, backdraft, Spider-Man and jaws have NO ENGLISH at all so you have to just enjoy the ride with no idea what‚Äôs actually being said.  It was good fun for a day but at close to $200 AUD each for entry and a fast pass, the Singapore one is much better.",Universal Studios Japan
Olivia L,4.0," January 7, 2020",Enjoyable - one of the better amusement parks,Highly recommend Prebooking express tickets if you can afford. Very expensive and they were sold out anyway when we bought tickets at the gate. So we had to wait in line like all the other commoners.  Unfortunately we went during Christmas/new year so children were on school holidays. The good thing was that the lines were shorter than they were labelled. 40 minute waits were usually 20.  The bad thing was there was no wifi in the park so I couldn‚Äôt message my husband. Which meant we had to wait for each other to finish a ride with one of our kids before coming back and going to another ride (one child was too scared to go on roller coasters.. or anything really). So we didn‚Äôt get to go on every ride we wanted to.  The main roller coaster in Jurassic Park had a huge 75 minute wait so we decided to sacrifice that one. It looked amazing though. Hanging from the harness in a flying kind of position.  My favourite ride was the Space Fantasy. I think it could be my favourite ride ever actually. Zipping around the universe and taking in the sights of Saturn and other planets was so fun! Something beautiful to look at whilst simultaneously hurtling around and screaming with joy made it very memorable.  Would not recommend going to the 3D/4D shows if you can‚Äôt understand Japanese. They don‚Äôt have translation and we just stood there wondering how to escape because we had such limited precious time (it wasn‚Äôt possible to leave because we were standing in the middle of a large crowd).,Universal Studios Japan

Grant Senjaya,5.0," January 2, 2020","Enjoyed End of Year 2019 Here, will come back given the chance","Went here on 31 Dec 2019, family trip with 2 small children (8&5).  As any major tourist attraction in high season, it is very crowded. Everything from entrance, rides, restaurants and toilets needs queue.  As a very large park, USJ managed well with the crowds. But unfortunately is very tiring to get from one place to another.  We entered and went directly to Harry Potter ride inside the Hogwarts castle. As a huge fan, almost all of the things in the HP world brings a smile to my face (but butterbeer is overrated to my muggle taste).  Next to Jurassic Park, had lunch which is expensive and tasted average, but no other option. My wife who is an adrenaline junkie loves the Flying Dinosaur. Using single line, we didn‚Äôt wait too long for her. While waiting, the kids enjoyed My Friend Dinosaur parade. Then we all went for Jurassic Park the ride and got a little bit wet and cold (winter, duh).  After Jurassic, went to Snoopy area, and queue to flying snoopy, but as the Express pass holder entered and entered the line, the reguler line didn‚Äôt move at all. We then gave up for the flying snoopy and went indoor for the snoopy roller coaster, a little queue there. My little boy enjoyed Elmo‚Äôs car. Then we went up the carousell but after a 10 mins delay, they announced that it was broken and we were asked to dismount.  Then we went to watch SING theatre, quite entertaining and a good rest as it is sitting down for around 10 mins.  Unfortunately we just found out that on that day, the park closed at 5. We misread the info that the park is open for 26 hours. Indeed it is open till midnight (fireworks show) but after 5PM, you will need another ticket to enjoy the park after hours.  So after finding out that the park is closing, we only got the chance to ride one more which is Minions Race, just a spinning ride.  Overall, the park is very enjoyable eventhough crowded. All of the staff is very friendly and making the guest experience very enjoyable.  Recommended for everyone, and if given the chance I will come back again with my family as we only rode less that 25% of all of the rides.",Universal Studios Japan

The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do. There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele.
