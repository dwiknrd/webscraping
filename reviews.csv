"June 30, 2020",40,Always reliable,We ate at the bar after a show. Nachos and salad with a couple of glasses of wine. Just the right stuff at the right time in a energetic atmosphere. Thank you Duane!
"March 17, 2020",50,It's not noisy,"It may sound noisy initially but if you find a good place at the bar, the noises fade away and you can enjoy the company of your partner. One of the best Hard Rock Cafes one finds anywhere in the world."
"March 13, 2020",40,Good burger and unique atmosphere,"I had a very good burger here. The atmosphere is unique but do not expect hard rock music, there were more rap and pop video clips than rock."
