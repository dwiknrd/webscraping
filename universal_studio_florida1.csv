Natasha L,5.0," May 19, 2021",Despite the Circumstances,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short.",Universal Studios Florida

Aleisha523,1.0," May 19, 2021",Don’t buy a package with one of their partner hotels!,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!",Universal Studios Florida

kanukgirl0,2.0," May 18, 2021","Money Money money, it’s. Rich mNs world","Universal studios... three theme parks 1 universal studios. A walk through the park with its many shops and. Few rides, NOT worth the price we paid. The food places are over priced, Nd very poor quality food, the City walk restaurants Re much better. In universal it cost me $9.90 for an ice cream only 2 scoops. There Re very few rides for children, a couple of adult rides. Not worth going. I paid over $730. For two people for three days at the three parks. Park 2 Adventure land? Much better, but still few kiddy rides and rides for people who dont want a roller coaster. If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it.",Universal Studios Florida

DelBueno,2.0," May 18, 2021",From bad to worse as time goes by.,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted.",Universal Studios Florida
Mrbucketlist,5.0," May 17, 2021",There's Disney...then THERES UNIVERSAL ORLANDO,"This has been a long time coming. I've literally been coming to this park since I was a child. After growing up, moving to florida, even working here for a year and now being an annual pass holder I can say I love this park. It's not perfect and no park is but the technology they have added in there rides are amazing!!! Now I'm personally more of a fan of Islands of adventure myself but I always visit both parks while I'm there. Yes I prefer these parks over disney just because of the ease of everything while here. Plus they have actual thrill rides, unlike Disney. Regardless all the theme parks in Florida are great. You'll enjoy it- MrBucketlist",Universal Studios Florida
TWOGTHEPUG,5.0," May 17, 2021",Consistently Magical,"I've been to Universal multiple times and have always been amazed at what they can do to make you really feel like you are in a world of magic. Harry Potter land is very impressive and fun for everyone. If you want to take your kids to the Wand Experience, go early or late so you don't run into crowds and have to wait a while and not get picked. Also, wear Harry Potter gear- they're more likely to pick you! The food is above average, but the butterbeer is a must get. All Simpsons fans MUST go to Springfield, USA. It is very well done, and the ride is hilarious. I would recommend Bumblebee man's tacos. Keep in mind that I went before the pandemic was really bad, so this might not be the current situation. Hope this helps!",Universal Studios Florida
Tenaya G,1.0," May 16, 2021",After 9 movies how did Fast & Furious miss the mark,"The Fast n Furious Supercharged ride was disappointing to say the least. The walk through the garage preparing for the ride was cool, but the actual attraction was poorly thought out as we expected the attraction to give us a ""fast n furious"" feel. Its been a whole week and I am still talking with my wife about how disappointing the ride was. Whether the ride is revamped into a roller coaster or a thrill ride, riders want to feel the speed. I envision a coaster with two tracks, sleek jet black cars for the riders, a few death-defying hills with nice drops, and a mean race to the finish line just like you see in the movie races. With all the advances made with thrill rides and simulators, I struggle to understand how this ride was put together to provide a fast n furious experience and completely missed the mark. Instead, the rider ends up constantly twisting their necks trying to keep up with a mad street race with guns and felt absolutely nothing during the ride except for a cramp in your neck from all the twisting and turning. The creators of this ride need to go back to the drawing board as this ride had the potential to elevate Universal to one of the top parks in Orlando. Instead, this ride hurt the prestige of the park. The creators need to do better as my family and I were thoroughly disappointed.",Universal Studios Florida

Wendy L,2.0," May 13, 2021",Disney is so much better than Universal!,"This was only about my third trip to Universal, and the first time I stayed at one of their resorts. It was pretty disappointing. The main reason I wanted to stay at one of their resorts was so that I could get into the park an hour early. I got up and got there a little before 8, which was when the early opening started. Instead, we stood there 45 minutes until the gates opened. It turns out, if they don't have enough employees, they only open one gate (there are 2 parks). And, unfortunately, I was standing at the wrong gate. I wouldn't have minded if I'd been told this ahead of time.  Other disappointments were Cauldron Cakes -- used to be sooo much better, had been looking forward to it all day -- is now basically a cupcake in a silicone cauldron (used to have ganache and an edible chocolate handle). The app was not that great, didn't really give directions to attractions. Also, there were a lot of rides where you were required to ""debag"" and put any backpacks, etc. in a locker. While the lockers were free -- probably the only free thing in the park -- this got to be a pain.  While the hotel was nice and new (Dockside), the light right when you came in the door didn't work and the walls were thin. I collapsed around 8 PM after a fun day in the park and was awakened by the people next door coming in around 11.  I definitely prefer Disney for overall experience and especially customer service.

jznawllms,4.0," May 12, 2021",Our first trip to Universal was outstanding!!,"We spent a week at Universal Studios at the end of April. My husband and I and our 2 teenage sons had a wonderful time. We loved the rides in both parks and the Harry Potter worlds. Our only issue was lunch in The Three Broomsticks. We had purchased the quick service dining plan along with the freestyle souvenir cup. the third day we were told that our dining plan did not cover a drink with our meal since we had the freestyle cups. There are no sodas or freestyle stations to get drinks from in Harry Potter worlds. Drinks for 4 people would cost at least 16$ and I felt like I had already paid for this drink when paying for our dining plan. I asked to speak to manager but they would not come speak to me. Sent the kid to say we could have free glasses of water. Well, duh, you can get free water anywhere in the park. Any way, I let it go but it ruined our whole dining experience there. After we got home I looked over the information on the quick service and no where does it say that by getting the freestyle cup you would not get a regular, drink with your meal. It specifically states that a non alcoholic beverage comes with your dinner. I really only included ALL of this to let people know what to expect in the Harry Potter worlds. This was a major focus of our trip and to get so upset kinda ruined the day. Every other part of our trip was outstanding. Employees were always happy to help with any questions that we had about our first trip there.",Universal Studios Florida

If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it.",Universal Studios Florida
BlueRoyalty,5.0," May 18, 2021",Universal Florida,Great price. Great experience. It was super easy to get the tickets via email voucher from TripAdvisor. Not much social distancing at the parks but they only allow families on rides together which is nice.,Universal Studios Florida
DelBueno,2.0," May 18, 2021",From bad to worse as time goes by.,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted.",Universal Studios Florida

Natasha L,5.0," May 19, 2021",Despite the Circumstances,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short.",Universal Studios Florida

Aleisha523,1.0," May 19, 2021",Don’t buy a package with one of their partner hotels!,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!",Universal Studios Florida
Okp1245,2.0," May 19, 2021",rides close often,we went to universal on a class field trip and it sucked. we had 3 rides break down all in 1 day. never was able to ride the ripe rocket or whatever it’s called(the big red one) they said the wind was blowing to hard. we got stuck on the transformer ride and never got to re ride(they gave fast passes) we were in line for hulk and got almost to the top of the line and it broke down we stayed in like but waited like and hour and 30 minutes. the hotel was fun we stayed at cabana bay there was a lot to do if it wasn’t for the hotel fun the trip would have been rlly bad.,Universal Studios Florida
