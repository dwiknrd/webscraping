I never knew who Jason Bourne was... but now I will be buying the movies. This was absolutely awesome, amazing and 100% worth the entire cost of the trip by itself. So worth the wait and every time I went it was packed. I would have passed it up thinking it was nothing WRONG!!!! ...DONT MISS THIS!!!!",Universal Studios Florida

This isn’t a vacation,Universal Studios Florida
annapN7702ZW,2.0," May 27, 2021",Expected More,"I just expected more. Alot of waiting around, lack of staffing and over priced tickets for what you actually get. They wanted over $700 bucks for a cabana at Volcano Bay! The express passes were close to $150.00 bucks. They need to take lessons from Disney as they seem to have the crowd control down. City Walk was just a bunch of kids hanging out all night. Just Eh. It's been 15 years since my last visit and now I know why.",Universal Studios Florida
Deb P,2.0," May 27, 2021",Disapointing.....,"This was my 4th trip with my daughter to Universal and unfortunately my most disappointing. Most of which had nothing to do with Covid restrictions. We stayed on-site at the Hard Rock and of course had the fast passes. At the time of our stay May 18-22 there was no housekeeping at all. All trash and used towels were left in the hallway and a phone call had to be made for fresh towels. So walking down the hallway to dirty towels and trash wasn't the most pleasant experience. Hotel aside my biggest complaints were the crowds and long lines for the rides and food. Fast passes were of course not available on the newer attractions, so 1 hour plus waits for those rides. Most other rides were about 1/2 the wait time. Most sit down restaurants in the park and at city walk had no walk up times and reservations were few and far between. Make sure you make them well ahead of time as there was limited seating. Take out at the food court at city walk was well over an hour. They were well under staffed (3 employees at Moe's) and the line was far out the door. The area was dirty and the trash was overflowing. It just appears as Universal is not prepared for the crowds they are letting in. I guess we just expected more for the money we spent. We love Universal, but I am very leary about coming back anytime soon.",Universal Studios Florida
Chuck N,1.0," May 27, 2021",Greed makes for a terrible guest experience,"Universal is one thing - Not Disney. Everything Disney does well Universal dues poorly. We arrived just before opening (9 AM) and exited our car in the marking deck. We were met with a line so long it went from security, all the way across 2 bridges and circled back on itself 4 times in the marking deck. After an hour we realized the line was not really being enforced and people were going around so we followed a small crowd up closer and still had another 1/2 hour wait to get in. There were NO employees helping to direct traffic or people. I asked an employee once we got through security and they simply said that they were not limiting the parks and that they were extremely short staffed. Only about 1/3 of the employees had been hired back but the crowds were overwhelming them.  The rest of the day went about the same. 1 hour for coffee. 1.5 hours to get food. We managed to ride ONE ride in 7 hours and finally left due to frustration.  Not much changes. If you have been before don't waste your time. For the first time Harry Potter fans its interesting to walk around and shop but good luck doing much. 90+ minutes to ride the hogwarts express.  They did have mask policies but no one was around to enforce them so what was the point? They had hand sanitizer stations but I did not find a single one with anything in it. They clearly care about $$ and not guests or employees. I won't be back and I'd take a Disney park (which were below capacity and a great experience for less $$) any day.",Universal Studios Florida
Jen,4.0," May 26, 2021",Good first time visit with kids,"We spent 6 nights on site at Sapphire Falls as a family of 6 (2 adults, 4 kids age 5-14) with a 4 day park hopper pass. We did not get the express pass, but if you want to do rides and aren't there for four days, I don't know how you would experience this park without them. The early park admission didn't do much as only Universal Studios offered it during the days we were there. This ended up being the busiest times of Wizarding World throughout the day and the longest line at the gate. We did Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday to avoid the Saturday crowd. Sunday was the lightest day with regard to crowds.  The theme park did a great job of immersion in the lines and having a little something for everyone. If you are pregnant or are prone to motion sickness, you will struggle to find rides you can do. Our little ones loved Fieval's playland and Dr. Seuss Landing. They also enjoyed the Men in Black Ride. Our older kiddos, who were new to theme parks and coasters, enjoyed a varied array of rides and shows. Animal Antics show was ok- Indianapolis zoo has one similar but much better. Bourne Stuntactcular was amazing. The Ripsaw falls and Popeye's barge were a hoot.  Wizarding World was quite neat. So well done to every fine detail. Unfortunately, employees don't seem to get that memo and ruin the ""magic"" a bit. Gringotts and Hagrid's were amazing rides. Worth the wait. We found Gringotts rarely had a line around 10am after the initial early entrance arrivals went through. Hagrid's line went down the lowest around noon (45 minutes).  We had a lovely time and it was a memorable vacation. Here are a few things to keep in mind or I wish Universal would improve on:  --I don't think I encountered any ""above and beyond"" employees. Most seemed annoyed that guests were in the park. I felt like a stone in their shoe rather than a guest. It was a rare occurrence to get a friendly wave as we entered or left a line.  --Breakfast at the Three Broomsticks was absolutely horrendous (we had breakfast tickets with our package). The girl's pancakes were stale as though they had sat for a couple hours under a heat lamp. It took almost 20 minutes after being seated for someone to come to our table and the place was mostly empty. My eggs were obviously some powdered version and were barely edible. Once the food was delivered, no one came by to refill drinks or ask us about our food. Thankfully, the food and experience at the Leaky Cauldron was 100% better.  --The ""quick service"" dining locations where you mobile ordered and they brought food to your table was incredibly slow- usually about a 45-60 minute wait for food. There was no way to order cups of water on the mobile device, and when we asked for it when the waiter brought our food they seemed quite put out by the request. Maybe this wait is normal, but it was unexpected for us. It was so hard to find water in the park and you always felt like you were the biggest annoyance when asking for it. Many of the freestyle machines (I had been told you could get water from for free) did not offer free water.  --I stood in quite a few lines where the employees were much more interested in talking to one another than interacting with guests. In one line, they were talking about how hammered they had gotten at a party over the weekend. Another kept complaining about how hot and tired they were to another employee and couldn't wait to go on break. These were just a couple of examples. It was as if the park guests were invisible.  --We went knowing the mask rules, followed them to the best of our ability, and were thankful for the ability to not wear them outside when not in line. However, the rules did not make any sense in some instances. The most aggressive employees about masks were on the Red Fish, Blue Fish ride. They would literally interrupt the whole ride and song when a kid's mask fell off in flight below their nose or they moved it down when it got wet. These kids are outside, in the air moving, and at least 15 feet apart from each other. Literally, there is essentially no risk or reason to have masks on in that environment- why interrupt the ride to yell at them? It was just annoying.  One way they did GREAT in the park as we got shut down twice on rides and they did a great job of making it right. Men in Black broke down while we were on it. They kept us all calm and escorted us out with laughter and smiles and a one-time express pass. We waited in line for over an hour for Hagrids when it broke down. They gave everyone in line an exclusive express pass that included coming back to Hagrid's to cut the line which was a tremendous blessing. We also had breakdown problems at Minions and again on Hagrid's when we actually rode it (delay after the devil's snare for a brief bit that was a little terrifying as we could hear the next riders above us and were afraid they'd drop on us!).  The Universal App worked pretty well, but the wait times were rarely accurate for rides. Sometimes it was half as long as it was listed, sometimes twice as long. We went to go to Shrek and when we arrived at the line it said 25 minutes. Throughout our LONG line it continued to say that. Nearly an hour later, we finally got in. We went to Gringotts for a 20 minute line- and there was literally no wait- we climbed right in a vehicle! Mobile ordering was easy- but it doesn't save time. Paying on the universal app was sketchy and it wasn't accepted at the quick food service at CityWalk.  If Universal could improve its staffing both from a quality and quantity perspective, it would really benefit the guest experience.  We had purchased the Harry Potter package- in all, not worth the extra cost.",Universal Studios Florida
Paul S,1.0," May 26, 2021",Same old Orlando experience.,I'm literally standing in a line for the Hagrid thing that I scheduled a slot on using the app. They've packed as many people in the line as they possibly can and are harping at us (threatening to kick us out of line for having our masks off our noses so that we can breath.,Universal Studios Florida
Mandee L,5.0," May 25, 2021",Family Vacation Fun,"Universal Adventure Park was the best out of two we went to. Both were impressively clean, not to crowded & everyone enjoyed themselves. Wait times were a bit long but we expected that.",Universal Studios Florida
Kate Z,2.0," May 25, 2021","Crowded, unhelpful staff, and difficult to get food/water.","It’s no Disney, I’ll tell you that much. We just returned from a one day visit to Universal with park to park passes. We spent the two prior days at Disney and then switched hotels to Endless Summer Dockside. As a married couple, Dockside doesn’t offer king sized beds and has no sit down restaurants, but does have a cafeteria. It’s swarmed with teens and early 20s.  The early entry to Harry Potter is a racket. We got up early and waited in line for a bus, then arrived and waited shoulder to shoulder in the biggest crowd I’ve ever seen to get through security. Then we walked in and waited in another line to get access to the park. As the employee scanned my ticket, they dropped the rope and let in the masses. I asked what’s the point of arriving early if you get in at the same time as the masses and the employee told me we needed to arrive at 6am to get into the 8am early admission. Once we were in the park it was shoulder to shoulder for most of the experience (and this May 2021, still in the pandemic purportedly at limited capacity). The employees were worthless and rarely could answer questions. Went to the Leaky Caldron and asked the employee at the exit, “can I get a coffee here?”, she said no and sent me to the Hopping Pot. Waited in line and asked if Witches Brew was coffee (it’s beer), employee said go to the Leaky Caldron. Went back to the entrance of the Leaky Caldron, couldn’t get in because it was closed for a private event. Returned later as it appeared there was a short line, the employee says order your food on the mobile app while you wait. We do, and as soon as we get inside, the queue is hidden and waited an hour for food. We were upset and felt deceived that part of the queue is hidden and there’s no sign with the wait posted. It’s like they trick you into ordering to get you’re money and then you’re stuck waiting, hungry and thirsty. The food was “ok” and the staff seemed like zombies. Gringotts ride and queue was awesome. Don’t wait in line to buy a wand at Gregorovitches, or anywhere for that matter, it’s not an experience and you can literally buy the same wands everywhere, they sold them in our hotel giftshop. Get your butter beer early as the lines just get longer as the day passes. Line for Hogwarts express only gets longer to. Was 10min around 10:30-11:00. Was 45 min by noon. Diagon Alley is shaded and comfortable temp wise, but there’s no place to sit and rest, as is a complaint for all of Universal and IOA. Getting food and water was tough throughout the park, not enough quick carts with water and long lines. Hogs Meade is hot and sunny, no place to sit in shade and rest. We rode forbidden journey. Got right in with single rider. Then decided to leave for the day. Rather than wait for Howart’s, we walked through IOA. It’s sunny, no place to sit, no shade. And bad signage through US and IOA. Also, universal app is terrible compared to Disney. Tried to stop at several restaurants and get a bite to eat, hours long waits. Got to Citywalk and hours long waits. Also, bad signage. Many restaurants were closed and rather just put up a sign that no restaurants were open, we wasted energy walking. Finally gave up and left park. As we were leaving through a different park than we entered, stopped to ask security guard how to get back to hotel. He was rude unhelpful, acted like he had never heard of Endless Summer Dockside and then laughed and snarkily said, “well how’d you get here” as if I was a moron for asking. I had to explain, I’m leaving through a different park than I entered through, and just shrugged his shoulder and said, the same way you got here. FYI, the busses are the same for both parks. You walk through citywalk for both parks and then go back through security and down to where the buss dropped you. If you strictly want to ride coasters, universe might be for you. We found that the park is geared toward teens and early 20s, and is by and large and lower caliber of park goer and certainly the employees don’t even come close to the level of hospitality and helpfulness you get from Disney. We probably won’t go back unless there is a major expansion to Harry Potter. If anything, our experience made us appreciate Disney all the more.",Universal Studios Florida
Kimberly T,1.0," May 24, 2021",Parking and Guest Services TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"We went to City Walk due to being with our quadriplegic son. Nothing but CHAOS in regards to parking. No STRUCTURE whatsoever. Unfortunately, we were in the lane furthest away from the handicap accessible area so we had to make our way all the way across to see if we could park in that area. We made it across -scary though- to try to ask the young lady if we could park in that area and she shoved us away, A guy not too - he did the same thing. Actually 4 people total. So we headed on with the rest of the crowd where we were sandwiched in. We parked and had to make it work to get him out. We went to Guest Services only for this guy to say ""we are working long hours"", told us he was working from 1 to 1 and maybe one of us could stand guard while he got out. He did go on to say he was making notes in the system, etc. I called maybe a day or so later to file a complaint as I was sure this guy didn't share our concerns and I was right. When I filed the complaint via phone, I was told my concerns would be shared with management as this was an ADA issue. He gave us a $15 gift card for whenever we returned. To date no one has reached out. All it would have taken was for one of thing to take a minute or so to see what we wanted. I was so disappointed as I have been to Universal many, many times and to have my son who was tragically hit by a CAR which is why he is quadriplegic, to have to park in this deck where his parents had to act as shields was ridiculous. Sad, sad, sad.",Universal Studios Florida

SunilnRiss,5.0," May 22, 2021",Stay at one of 3 resorts that offer EXPRESS PASSES,"The park is always awesome.

Natasha L,5.0," May 19, 2021",Despite the Circumstances,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short.",Universal Studios Florida

Aleisha523,1.0," May 19, 2021",Don’t buy a package with one of their partner hotels!,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!",Universal Studios Florida
Okp1245,2.0," May 19, 2021",rides close often,we went to universal on a class field trip and it sucked. we had 3 rides break down all in 1 day. never was able to ride the ripe rocket or whatever it’s called(the big red one) they said the wind was blowing to hard. we got stuck on the transformer ride and never got to re ride(they gave fast passes) we were in line for hulk and got almost to the top of the line and it broke down we stayed in like but waited like and hour and 30 minutes. the hotel was fun we stayed at cabana bay there was a lot to do if it wasn’t for the hotel fun the trip would have been rlly bad.,Universal Studios Florida
kanukgirl0,2.0," May 18, 2021","Money Money money, it’s. Rich mNs world","Universal studios... three theme parks 1 universal studios. A walk through the park with its many shops and. Few rides, NOT worth the price we paid. The food places are over priced, Nd very poor quality food, the City walk restaurants Re much better. In universal it cost me $9.90 for an ice cream only 2 scoops. There Re very few rides for children, a couple of adult rides. Not worth going. I paid over $730. For two people for three days at the three parks. Park 2 Adventure land? Much better, but still few kiddy rides and rides for people who dont want a roller coaster. If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it.",Universal Studios Florida
BlueRoyalty,5.0," May 18, 2021",Universal Florida,Great price. Great experience. It was super easy to get the tickets via email voucher from TripAdvisor. Not much social distancing at the parks but they only allow families on rides together which is nice.,Universal Studios Florida
DelBueno,2.0," May 18, 2021",From bad to worse as time goes by.,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted.",Universal Studios Florida
