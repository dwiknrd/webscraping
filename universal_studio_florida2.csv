Nancy C,5.0," May 24, 2021",Excellent Vacation,For all ages rides and restaurants lots of photo opportunities and a fantastic water show the best I have ever seen.,Universal Studios Florida
SunilnRiss,5.0," May 22, 2021",Stay at one of 3 resorts that offer EXPRESS PASSES,"The park is always awesome. It vets pretty crowded in the Harry Potter areas but all of the rides, shows, attractions are ""re-dunkously"" fun. My teens are 16, 17 and 19 and they cant get enough of this place.",Universal Studios Florida
Natasha L,5.0," May 19, 2021",Despite the Circumstances,"It was humid, it was windy, we had to wear masks, but Universal still didn’t disappoint. Here’s a little breakdown on what to expect:  May 18- This was a Tuesday, and we chose to go midweek due to better ticket prices and (we hoped) less of a crowd. Even in a pandemic, there are still many people who want to get out to experience some thrills, so the parks were busy. The Universal Studios park was our focus for the day, and we got there as soon as it opened. I recommend this: go as soon as it opens and immediately ride the most popular rides. There will be a shorter wait time. Gringotts was our first ride, and we only waited about 10-15 minutes. After 10:30, the parks tend to get busier and lines much longer. You do have to wear masks the entire time you are in line (even if you are standing in line outside), but you can take off your masks while walking around the park. This was really nice given the humidity. By about 11, most wait times at the Universal Studios park are about 40-60 minutes on average. Depending on the time of day, restaurants will also have longer waits. We went to Mel’s Drive-In at 11:30 with only a short wait. There is one thing to be aware of: weather. Because of high winds, Rip Ride Rocket was “delayed”. Many people were surprised by this and gave workers a hard time, but keep in mind this is for your safety.  May 19- In our opinion, if you had to choose between the parks, choose Islands of Adventure. There are more thrill rides, and rides in general. We once again got to the parks as it opened and right away only had 10 minute waits for the Hulk ride, King Kong, and Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey. Hulk and King Kong have about 60-80 minute waits on average. Lines started to get longer after 11:00. Here’s a tip: keep an eye on the Velocicoaster... it’s set to open on June 10, but there are random limited times the public can ride it. We rode it, and it was FANTASTIC if you love rollercoasters. Easily our favorite ride. Hagrid’s Motorbike Adventure is also a great experience. Again, don’t be surprised by long restaurant waits. Our longest wait time of the entire day was to enter the Three Broomsticks to eat for lunch (about 1:30 is when we got there). Worth the wait!  All-in-all, it’s still a great (and pricy) time despite the circumstances. If you need an escape, this is worth it!  (One more thing) Unless you are a huge Fast and Furious fan or have run out of rides, I would not wait longer than 30 minutes for Supercharged in the Universal Studios park. It’s underwhelming and very short.",Universal Studios Florida

Linkstrips,4.0," May 19, 2021",Over priced,"Went to is it Park on a Wednesday got there early.

Aleisha523,1.0," May 19, 2021",Don’t buy a package with one of their partner hotels!,"So this was our first visit to Universal. We have been Disney Passholders for years but just never did Universal. That being said I guess I am used to Disney customer service and they are definitely NO Disney. Our trip was to be a two week trip with the first 7 nights spent at a Disney resort and then a 4 night stay at Universal. When I called to order tickets they told me they had a special package deal. I asked about the package but told them I wanted to stay on their property. She told me there was no availability on their property for our dates but she had a partner hotel right across the street from Universal that was available. She said they had suites with a kitchenette available for a little more so I opted for the suite. She assured me that this was a great hotel, close to the parks and that we would get all the same benefits of staying on property since it was a partner hotel and a package through them.  I looked at pictures of this hotel while on the phone with her at it looked very and clean and since Universal was selling it to me I booked it.  We had called the resort the morning we were to check in to see if we could get an early check in so we could get settled and head to City Walk for the day. We called five times and no one would answer the phone. First red flag! We got there to see if we could check in early and they said they had a suite available. The pictures I added are just a few of the disgusting room they stuck us in. When you opened the door the smell almost knocked you over. Not to mention the stains and cigarette burns all over the carpet. It was filthy, paint chipping off the walls, the furniture was peeling and chipped every where. There was a piece of cardboard with water stains covering the front of the dishwasher. It was so gross! My husband called the front desk to complain and she said she would move us to a newly renovated room. So we moved all our luggage to the “newly renovated” room only to go to a room that looked like it had not been cleaned since they renovated it. The carpets were filthy, there was a brownish stain on the grey couch that looked disgusting. The toilet paper holder was falling off the wall, we open up the sleeper sofa just to see it and it was a mattress with plastic over it, there were no extra linens in the room for the sofa bed, the bed in the room looked like someone had been on it already and we had paid extra specifically for the kitchenette ( full fridge, sink, dishwasher, little stove top and microwave). This room had a mini fridge and microwave ( I can get that at any standard hotel for much cheaper).  We decided there was no way we were going to stay there but since we paid Universal we figured they would need to fix this. We called and waited for 1 and half hours to talk to someone. She was kind but kept telling us there was nothing available on their property for our dates. I assured her at that point it didn’t need to be on their property; I just wanted a clean and decent room. She said a supervisor would have to help us but she would have to put us on hold until she could get one. Another half hour and finally a supervisor gets on. We explain the situation, how bad the hotel is and that we want a different place. After we paid them for this. He tells us it is not their fault that the hotel isn’t nice and kept asking us “what do you want me to do about it” He too was saying that they had no hotels available on their property. Again, I told him he needed to find us a different property, I don’t care where it is. He was so rude and uncaring of the situation they had put us in. I told him that we could have just stayed longer at our Disney resort and bought tickets for Universal but because there agent assured me this was a partner hotel close to the parks; I booked it. After about another half an hour on the phone with him he finally tells my husband the only way he can e en help us is if he goes down and the hotel lets us check out with a refund. So my husband agrees to do that and says “how do I call you back?” He says “I have no direct line so you can’t.” I said at one point that I found a bolted available at Disney and we would just go back there. The supervisor says “well that’s your choice” My husband said “I will keep you on the phone then while I go see if we can check out” He goes down checks out and another 15 to 20 minutes later they magically have rooms available at Endless Summer Dockside. It was after 5 by the time we got all the this settled and checked in to Dockside. Funny thing is that Dockside was a cheaper resort so we actually paid less. Also, I checked hotels.com that evening just to check and sure enough, I could have reserved a room through them for the length of our stay at Dockside. They stuck us in a terrible resort and then didn’t want to take responsibility or help us in any way. The attitude we got from the supervisor was awful. We did complain to guest services but it was City Walks guest services. He said he would send the information to Universal and we would hear from someone. It’s been a week since we checked out and we have still heard nothing. Never an apology! Clearly Universal’s guest services sucks!!",Universal Studios Florida
Okp1245,2.0," May 19, 2021",rides close often,we went to universal on a class field trip and it sucked. we had 3 rides break down all in 1 day. never was able to ride the ripe rocket or whatever it’s called(the big red one) they said the wind was blowing to hard. we got stuck on the transformer ride and never got to re ride(they gave fast passes) we were in line for hulk and got almost to the top of the line and it broke down we stayed in like but waited like and hour and 30 minutes. the hotel was fun we stayed at cabana bay there was a lot to do if it wasn’t for the hotel fun the trip would have been rlly bad.,Universal Studios Florida
kanukgirl0,2.0," May 18, 2021","Money Money money, it’s. Rich mNs world","Universal studios... three theme parks 1 universal studios. A walk through the park with its many shops and. Few rides, NOT worth the price we paid. The food places are over priced, Nd very poor quality food, the City walk restaurants Re much better. In universal it cost me $9.90 for an ice cream only 2 scoops. There Re very few rides for children, a couple of adult rides. Not worth going. I paid over $730. For two people for three days at the three parks. Park 2 Adventure land? Much better, but still few kiddy rides and rides for people who dont want a roller coaster. If you like thrill rides then do this park. Food still garbage. Park 3 Volcano Bay. The best of all three. Take your own towel, unless you want to rent one for $6. Each. There Are things for older adults to do and children and thrill seekers, food is also much better and more reasonable priced. The Lazy river is the best , water 3 ft deep. Ride on an inner tube and have fun. If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios. I would recommend you skip the first park and stick to the other two. As for gift buying... dont buy anything inside the parks, go to one of the many. Bargain stores outside of the parks , you’ll get the same things as a quarter of the price. Try BENZER INTERNATIONAL INC 6454 International dr. T Shirts as low as $1.99 each I would not go back to Universal Studios. It was far to Expensive, and parking is $26 per day or $40 per day to park a little closer (. Not much closer) you still have a very long way to walk to get into the actual park... all in all Universal Studio is NOT worth it.",Universal Studios Florida
BlueRoyalty,5.0," May 18, 2021",Universal Florida,Great price. Great experience. It was super easy to get the tickets via email voucher from TripAdvisor. Not much social distancing at the parks but they only allow families on rides together which is nice.,Universal Studios Florida
DelBueno,2.0," May 18, 2021",From bad to worse as time goes by.,"As Florida residents we've been to both universal parks many times over the years and one thing is for sure, each visit seems to have been worse than the previous one. Today, was no exception and the criticisms are plenty so let me begin: 1. Prices. Paying just shy of $800 in admission for one day for four people is plain obscene particularly when I consider what we got for that amount of money: In all, we were only able to ride SIX, got that right 6 rides despite relative low crowds. In the past we visited on days with crowds similar to today's and were able to ride almost all rides and repeat some with little waiting time but not today. Today, the parks seemed understaffed so we ended up with wait times befitting peak crowds in summer with some rides clicking a 70-minute wait. Again, and I can't stress this enough, today's attendance was light as evident by the empty parking lots. 2. Terrible organization. The ""geniuses"" running things decided to make even buying food an ordeal in itself. From 11am on we tried repeatedly to purchase drinks or food to no avail because even a simple line to buy butter beer at the harry potter side of things was a lengthy process. We were not able to drink or eat until 3pm and that, with minor children, is a big problem. One would think that in this post-pandemic times universal would have more venues open to avoid people conglomerating but no sir the ""geniuses"" think that having people line up in confined spaces for long wait times is just what we need to diminish the risks of corona virus transmission. I won't even get into the pricing for the drinks and food because that's another obscenity: $90 for four burgers and drinks is just absurd. 3. Rude staff. While most staff was cordial the fact is that the few bad apples make a more lasting impression and on that I can't avoid thinking of the two morons working at the security check point both of whom were rude, literally herding us with ""hurry up"" when we had been held back ourselves because of their own incompetence and then, there's the attendant at one of the harry potter rides who insisted in having me store my small bag (which I have used many times before at universal) while having no issue with women's purses that were significantly larger. I didn't oblige her smugness and simple placed my small bag under my shirt and not once was it an issue during the rides. So this sums up the nightmarish day our visit to universal studios and islands of adventure turned out to be. It's quite telling when children tell you that service was poor isn't it? That's what happened to us today. In the end we felt so disgusted by the whole thing that we didn't even bother staying overnight and drove back home to put some distance between us and this crappy nightmare the universal studios and islands of adventure have become. Would we recommend these two parks? Sure, if you're predisposed to being taken advantage and taken for granted.",Universal Studios Florida
Mrbucketlist,5.0," May 17, 2021",There's Disney...then THERES UNIVERSAL ORLANDO,"This has been a long time coming. I've literally been coming to this park since I was a child. After growing up, moving to florida, even working here for a year and now being an annual pass holder I can say I love this park. It's not perfect and no park is but the technology they have added in there rides are amazing!!! Now I'm personally more of a fan of Islands of adventure myself but I always visit both parks while I'm there. Yes I prefer these parks over disney just because of the ease of everything while here. Plus they have actual thrill rides, unlike Disney. Regardless all the theme parks in Florida are great. You'll enjoy it- MrBucketlist",Universal Studios Florida
TWOGTHEPUG,5.0," May 17, 2021",Consistently Magical,"I've been to Universal multiple times and have always been amazed at what they can do to make you really feel like you are in a world of magic. Harry Potter land is very impressive and fun for everyone. If you want to take your kids to the Wand Experience, go early or late so you don't run into crowds and have to wait a while and not get picked. Also, wear Harry Potter gear- they're more likely to pick you! The food is above average, but the butterbeer is a must get. All Simpsons fans MUST go to Springfield, USA. It is very well done, and the ride is hilarious. I would recommend Bumblebee man's tacos. Keep in mind that I went before the pandemic was really bad, so this might not be the current situation. Hope this helps!",Universal Studios Florida
Tenaya G,1.0," May 16, 2021",After 9 movies how did Fast & Furious miss the mark,"The Fast n Furious Supercharged ride was disappointing to say the least. The walk through the garage preparing for the ride was cool, but the actual attraction was poorly thought out as we expected the attraction to give us a ""fast n furious"" feel. Its been a whole week and I am still talking with my wife about how disappointing the ride was. Whether the ride is revamped into a roller coaster or a thrill ride, riders want to feel the speed. I envision a coaster with two tracks, sleek jet black cars for the riders, a few death-defying hills with nice drops, and a mean race to the finish line just like you see in the movie races. With all the advances made with thrill rides and simulators, I struggle to understand how this ride was put together to provide a fast n furious experience and completely missed the mark. Instead, the rider ends up constantly twisting their necks trying to keep up with a mad street race with guns and felt absolutely nothing during the ride except for a cramp in your neck from all the twisting and turning. The creators of this ride need to go back to the drawing board as this ride had the potential to elevate Universal to one of the top parks in Orlando. Instead, this ride hurt the prestige of the park. The creators need to do better as my family and I were thoroughly disappointed.",Universal Studios Florida
Simon S,5.0," May 16, 2021",Fantastic visit,Cannot fault universal studios absolutely loving every minute spent here much prefer it over the Disney parks so much more modern and advanced makes Disney seem dated all the rides keep you entertained while queuing and as person who hasn't watched all the Harry Potter films you don't need to it's just WOW amazing well done universal after marrying my wife and having my children best time of my life,Universal Studios Florida

Wendy L,3.0," May 13, 2021",Fun rides but poor customer service!,"Many fun simulator rides and I love the ""Wizarding World,"" but overall customer service stinks. Specifically, couldn't get in early because only 1 gate was open, even though I stayed at a Universal resort solely so I could go in early. And paying twice to go in two connected parks is the biggest theme park rip-off ever!",Universal Studios Florida
Wendy L,2.0," May 13, 2021",Disney is so much better than Universal!,"This was only about my third trip to Universal, and the first time I stayed at one of their resorts. It was pretty disappointing. The main reason I wanted to stay at one of their resorts was so that I could get into the park an hour early. I got up and got there a little before 8, which was when the early opening started. Instead, we stood there 45 minutes until the gates opened. It turns out, if they don't have enough employees, they only open one gate (there are 2 parks). And, unfortunately, I was standing at the wrong gate. I wouldn't have minded if I'd been told this ahead of time.  Other disappointments were Cauldron Cakes -- used to be sooo much better, had been looking forward to it all day -- is now basically a cupcake in a silicone cauldron (used to have ganache and an edible chocolate handle). The app was not that great, didn't really give directions to attractions. Also, there were a lot of rides where you were required to ""debag"" and put any backpacks, etc. in a locker. While the lockers were free -- probably the only free thing in the park -- this got to be a pain.  While the hotel was nice and new (Dockside), the light right when you came in the door didn't work and the walls were thin. I collapsed around 8 PM after a fun day in the park and was awakened by the people next door coming in around 11.  I definitely prefer Disney for overall experience and especially customer service. This may be my last Universal trip.",Universal Studios Florida
jznawllms,4.0," May 12, 2021",Our first trip to Universal was outstanding!!,"We spent a week at Universal Studios at the end of April. My husband and I and our 2 teenage sons had a wonderful time. We loved the rides in both parks and the Harry Potter worlds. Our only issue was lunch in The Three Broomsticks. We had purchased the quick service dining plan along with the freestyle souvenir cup. the third day we were told that our dining plan did not cover a drink with our meal since we had the freestyle cups. There are no sodas or freestyle stations to get drinks from in Harry Potter worlds. Drinks for 4 people would cost at least 16$ and I felt like I had already paid for this drink when paying for our dining plan. I asked to speak to manager but they would not come speak to me. Sent the kid to say we could have free glasses of water. Well, duh, you can get free water anywhere in the park. Any way, I let it go but it ruined our whole dining experience there. After we got home I looked over the information on the quick service and no where does it say that by getting the freestyle cup you would not get a regular, drink with your meal. It specifically states that a non alcoholic beverage comes with your dinner. I really only included ALL of this to let people know what to expect in the Harry Potter worlds. This was a major focus of our trip and to get so upset kinda ruined the day. Every other part of our trip was outstanding. Employees were always happy to help with any questions that we had about our first trip there.",Universal Studios Florida
Eric Zimmerman,5.0," May 11, 2021",Great Parks and Fair Value,"Did the package resort and park deal. All the rides were really good. Masks are required over the mouth and nose, and they’re serious. Lots of hand sanitizer at every ride, and you must use it. I’d highly recommend the trip.",Universal Studios Florida
May,2.0," May 11, 2021",Overpriced,"So far I have been on hold for over an hour to ask questions about tickets. They close according to eastern time so us pacific time folks have to call early. The park is only open until 7 pm? The price is more than ever and goes up based on the date you picked. If my kids didn’t make me, I wouldn’t visit this overpriced park. Way more expensive than Disney. Add $200 a person for express passes when the tickets are over $170?",Universal Studios Florida
KathleenS,1.0," May 10, 2021",Disappointing,"Just returned from weekend at Universal. Stayed at Portofino, which is always wonderful. I have had annual pass for past 6 years. I agree with other reviews: STAY HOME. The parks are painful in the heat with masks, and it is not even summer sizzling yet here in Florida. Mask police with bullhorns are roaming to yell that you cannot walk and drink. Usually, one of the bars is a great refuge for adult visitors. No, denied! You need reservations to sit at a bar. Then, good luck getting through the reservation line. Toothsome Chocolate Factory especially annoying where I always visit on trips. Friend and I booted off barstools since didn’t have a reservation. So disappointed in this trip to Universal. Our state is doing great with COVID containment; however, you would never know it in Orlando!",Universal Studios Florida
Kenneth E,1.0," May 10, 2021",Zero compassion for children,"I have a special needs child who just turned 3. He really wanted to go to Universal so we flew all the way out to Florida. When we were checking in at the front gate, the park rep started berating my 3 year old for not wearing a mask. I explained that he had sensory issues with his face and had a doctors note showing he could not wear a mask due to his medical condition. The park rep said, ""That's your problem not mine."" and kicked us out telling us we needed to go to park services. We had to wait in another 1 hour line just to get a wrist band identifying my child as special needs. This is not the way to treat people. I could tell this park rep had never had children the way he was treating us with such disrespect. I understand some people are in such fear of the pandemic but there are special needs children who have sensory issues with their face. We flew out to Florida since the governor lifted the mask mandate and figured we could have a good outdoor experience. Also, we went to Lego Land before this and had absolutely no issues. Lego land allowed kids under 8 to not wear masks. It will be hard for me to give Universal another try since the workers there have no respect for children.",Universal Studios Florida
Heather J,2.0," May 8, 2021",Family vacay,"We were disappointed because as a family of 12, 4 were under the age of 11 and unable to ride most things. We paid $145/ticket for each person, the kids area was closed down, there was a pretty severe storm that rolled through (no fault of the park obviously) and that shut down several things also. You have to buy multi day hopper pass because you can't purchase a single day, multi park ticket and thats $292 for 2 adults! Apparently we didn't research enough to know that the majority of the rides we were looking forward to, were in the Island of Adventure park, and we couldn't access them. We walked the entire park in a fairly short amount of time and half our group went back to the hotel because there was nothing for the little people to do after about 2.5 hours. The other half stayed longer to ride a few things and even at half capacity, we still had to wait 60 minutes for the Harry Potter ride which was cool, but short and not worth the wait. I couldn't imagine waiting hours for it! As typical, food was crazy expensive and just ehhh, ok, parking $26.... There was no sanitization available at the drink refill stations and everyone just kept touching the same surfaces and I never saw anyone wiping them down. We were so excited for this visit and were incredibly disappointed in our first experience.",Universal Studios Florida
Jewel G,1.0," May 8, 2021",Reality TV theme park style,"On day one we were seriously aware that no one was enforcing the cleaning, masking or distancing restrictions. The staff at the stores in CityWalk were rude and not accommodating. The parks were ok during the week but its dirty with long chaotic lines. The only reason to go is to see Harry Potter in my opinion. My suggestion is go during the week and go early otherwise you will be packed in with hundreds of others in the heat without proper restrictions. We stayed in the last day to watch the reality tv show that was occurring hourly between patrons and staff by the pool at the hotel. Save your money and go to Disney.",Universal Studios Florida
Sarah L,5.0," May 7, 2021",Loved it,"Our family did both parks in two days during COVID, with a park hopper. We intentionally chose this time to go in the hopes of lower crowds due to reduced capacity limits. We also picked the first week of May for the same reason - hoping for slightly lower crowds.  It was our first time to Universal theme parks, and we had a great time. My kids are probably unusually adventurous and hardy (as a friend of our says, they are like little Vikings), so at 11 and 6 they both had a blast here, and found it a little more exciting than Disney (“less boring” as my 6 year old said). We did opt for the unlimited Express-pass, and we were not sure it was worth it. This could be due to the reduced capacity. Which I will say I can’t imagine these parks with 50% more people in them. I would never come here during peak season, as the parks themselves are more compact than Disney. We had the ability to child-swap with the family we came with, so all of us were able to ride most of the rides twice. So by the second day, we didn’t really want to ride anything again, which made the unlimited pass seem unnecessary. I wouldn’t come here without at least the one time express pass though, because in two days we did everything! Overall, we found the food situation a bit difficult to navigate, but I feel like once you get to know it, it made more sense. It was hard to just find food when you were hungry without excessive waits. The mobile ordering was not really intuitive, and we couldn’t get my account working to try it anyway.  Here’s what we loved about US. Diagon Ally is amazing, and we spent quite a bit of time here. There are more 3D-4D rides on this side, and we really enjoyed them, although not everyone in our party was as interested. My daughters loved the Simpsons ride and it’s pretty funny. In fact one of the things we enjoyed about Universal, was a lot of laughs, wit, humor and the sense of immersion in the movie.  Drawbacks were few, the main one being the Wand Experience, which is a hyped up sales pitch. A tip is get there during early admission if you can the first day and sign up it, then purchase the wand. After the experience we didn’t have the heart to say no to them, and ended up buying two more wands. The other disappointing thing was they only chose our oldest daughter for the show. Luckily I asked about it as they ushered us out (as I didn’t that understand going into it), and they nicely called us back in. They did a truncated version of the show for my little one, but she rolled with it. My youngest always seems to get the short end of the stick, so I was initially mortified by this, as she just wilted as we were walking out. My tip would be to let the wand master know that both kids need a wand (they did both the kids for the family we were traveling with) or ask about booking different times.",Universal Studios Florida
amway60436,3.0," May 6, 2021",Ok...,"First off most of the information given to me by Guest Services over the phone was inaccurate. The dining plan is only good within the parks according to a staff member at our resort and the refillable cups are only good in the parks as well. The freestyle cup has to be activated daily which is a major inconvenience since you have to wait in long lines just to activate a cup then go look for a station to fill it at. A staff member at our resort actually told us even though 1 of the restaurants within the resort is listed as quick service facility they don't accept the dining card and when I mentioned it to a staff member at the park she seemed surprised and said ""I guess I learned something today."" The 2 park per day ticket is only good for the theme parks which I had been told it applied to all 3 parks. If you want to go to Volcano Bay you have to purchase the 3 park ticket. The photo package was a total waste of money. Only a few rides take pics and I only saw 1 person in front of the theme park taking pics which I never got since she told me she couldn't scan my photo pass she had to give me a different card each time and I wasn't able to download them. Maybe we are a little spoiled by Disney since everything is extremely convenient with them. Everything with Universal is unorganized and wastes a ton of time. If they made everything accessible through the app it would be so much easier. The only thing good about Universal is they keep the ride lines moving and the wait is not that long at all but summertime may be different.",Universal Studios Florida
Coastal299113,1.0," May 6, 2021",good time at City Walk and Portofino hotel,"We were a group of 3 older women with canes that love Harry Potter. The attendants on the rides were great, but some other workers - such as the wicked wizards at Olivetti's wands were just plain rude. They refused to answer questions just said 'we had to have a tablet' and to 'go away' . We found a more personable wizard the next day and he explained that we had to be there very early (and we had early admission and got there asap) and did not give us much hope. We did not want to come back at 5 in hopes of a cancellation. High heat , masks, old women and wicked wizards just do not work. We stayed in park just in the mornings and did not come back the 3rd day. Stay away",Universal Studios Florida
Kathy E,3.0," May 6, 2021",Universal - too hot for masks,"My husband and I visited Universal a couple years ago and had a fantastic time. This trip didn’t meet those expectations. The rides IF/WHEN you got to them met our expectations. Several were closed for most of the day. Temps hit 95 all days we were there. You were forced to wear a mask all the time except when you were “actively eating or drinking in a stationary spot.” The Express Passes ruined our visit. I get it the Express People paid extra, but there needs to be limits to give the Gen Pop a fair chance at the rides. A 25 min wait at the train turned into a 70 min wait in the hot dungeon with our faces covered. People were dropping from the heat.  Places to eat and drink experiences long, slow, never-ending lines of people waiting in the sun. Since our last visit, Universal has added two huge hotels and two new, modern rollercoasters, but no new places to get food and drink. The park has limited infrastructure and the visitors needs need to be addressed too.  We stayed at Endless Summer hotel which was very nice, but the lobby stayed warm due to all the people. (It was only 1/2 full too.) Pier 8 offered some reasonably priced food items. Some items we wish we could have used, but we had no microwave in our room. :.( Staff members were friendly and courteous. We also had to buy coffee in the park since we don’t drink Starbucks and we also didn’t have a coffee maker in our room.  We chose this time because school was still in session. Ha! Can you say “virtual learning!” We cut our vacation short by a day. Between the heat, masks, and crowds, we’d had enough.",Universal Studios Florida
Erica C,1.0," May 6, 2021",Terrible. DANGEROUS.,"I’m in Universal Studios right now standing in an outside line. It’s 90 degrees here. The wait is 70 minutes long and they just broadcasted an announcement that “for everyone’s safety no eating or drinking is permitted while in line. Please keep your face covering over your mouth and nose at all times.” Meanwhile we are standing in the sun, dripping in sweat, and the lines are “socially distanced”.",Universal Studios Florida

LivingTheDream,1.0," May 4, 2021",Save the respiratory distress and money,"✅ $850💵 + ⏰ hours of high heat 91 degrees🔥 & 😷☀️. We were shocked to be in long lines walking about 7.5 miles for the day masked up! Like sheep 🐑 being threatened constantly with loud speaker 🔈announcements demanding no drinking 🥤or eating while walking 🚶‍♀️& maintain social distancing, wearing a mask at all times or being 👢booted from the park. I saw kids 👆touching all handrails and then putting hands in their parents cups eating ice and then the parents gulping down the remainder(at $10 per beverage can you blame them) 🤷‍♂️ confused I do thousands of people show up to spend 💰💰💰💰💰💰if they are paranoid of public places! Universal Studios is a germs 🦠 paradise! They also pray on people’s wallets with the nifty reservation system it allows them to supply and demand fast passes from $80 extra to $249 demanding on all the variables they control! We despised being ordered around with lousy customer service! Constant loud interruptions🛑 during the rides 🎢demanding guests wear a mask 😷! Save yourself the 💰money, headaches 💊 and don’t go!! It’s ridiculous hypocrisy! Stay home save yourself the money and respiratory distress wearing a mask in 91 degree weather! Big brother is 👀watching!",Universal Studios Florida
TBarbette,1.0," May 4, 2021",Vacations Packages are a scam!,"I've been waiting multiple DAYS on the phone to modify my vacation package (I do have the paid Cancellation option, but we did not even get that far...).  And of course any change cannot be done online. I can only advise people to stay far from the vacation packages! Find a tour operator or buy tickets separately. Or do so if you are sure you don't need to change anything. I guess in covid times nobody can say that though. You would have to go anyway and spread the virus, or loose thousands of $... For sure they won't allow to reimburse a-posteriori as it's a 7 days prior limit in the conditions.  Not even sure I want to go anymore now...",Universal Studios Florida
Ilaria T,4.0," May 3, 2021","Awesome experience, with a couple tips...","We totally loved our experience at Universal mid April, with two kids 10 and 6. I have a few important tips: -100% buy the express pass, it's totally worth it. Without it, no way to enjoy all the rides even during a weekday; -bring snacks/food and water bottles. We had a stroller even if my daughter is way too old to use it on a daily basis, but it was awesome to be able to carry stuff all over the park. We didn't have to wait in line for food as we packed sandwiches and snacks; - skip the shops and buy souvenirs outside the park if you want to save money and wait lines; - skip the VIP parking; -wr hated the Virtual line system for the Hagrid ride. We couldn't get on despite trying for two days. They should just allow standby lines in addition to virtual lines to avoid so many frustrated people clicking insanely on their phones; -skip the Pterodactyl ride if the line is more than 20 minutes. It's so short it's not worth it; -must do for us: HP escape from Gringotts, HP journey, Transformers 3D, The Mummy, Jurassic river adventure, Hulk rollercoaster, Tycoon Lagoon... All in all, it was amazing and I would definitely do it again!",Universal Studios Florida
Betty A,2.0," May 1, 2021",Disappointed,"This was our 3rd and by far worst experience at Universal. We had a park to park pass and only rode a total of 6 rides due to long wait times and shortened hours . We stayed on Universal Property which was wonderful with the exception of over priced food options. Anyway, even with early park entry it was very disappointing. We did look into fast passes and found out they were far too expensive (@$240 per person) which is way out of budget after paying the park to park admission. Lines were long the park was over crowded and people were not observing social distancing. We tried getting reservations same day at the restaurants on city walk and they were booked 3 days out .",Universal Studios Florida
Julie B,5.0," May 1, 2021",Good when no talking,We enjoyed the rides and attractions! The food was good! Many friends go here! The employees are rude! Never changed! Casey said she worked here! Thank you!,Universal Studios Florida
Karen B,2.0," April 30, 2021",Not worth it,"I don't understand the hype at all. Harry Potter Diagon Alley was the only good thing about this place but even at that it was incredibly overcrowded and we couldn't even experience any rides or shows. And the Dragon on Grigott's was not able to breathe the fire! The people working there said they didn't know why it wasn't working. Everything else in the park is outdated and irrelevant. Long lines, too crowded, not much to do, overpriced. Just a lot of stores to buy overpriced commercialized products. the one rollercoaster my daughter wanted to go on got closed down after she waited over an hour in line. And at some point during the day my other daughter's HP wand was stolen out of our bag that we had been carrying all day. It was never one placed down. We will NEVER return to this trap.",Universal Studios Florida
Mike M,1.0," April 29, 2021",A complete waste,Absolutely complete waste of money! Have a disabled child and the whole family got attitude and we were treated like garbage. Waited in hour in line because 2 people were working the line for a disability pass. Got the pass after several weird questions on her disability. The pass is useless once you pick a ride you wait for your time to return. In the meantime you can not go on another ride. So what do you do for an hour with a disabled child. Disney has no issues with there system. The food service is even worse recieved 2 burgers with hair in it. Didn't get our drinks till 20mins after we received the food. We and several other families were told with an attitude that they are behind on drinks! You expect me to believe it's harder to pour soda then make a burger. For 400$ we got to go on 2rides. Complete waste of 8hrs and 400 hundred dollars. STICK WITH DISNEY!!!,Universal Studios Florida
Tara W,5.0," April 28, 2021",Awesome Guest Service help,"I really needed to leave a review, we haven't been yet but planning is part of all the work. I did have trouble with the website and trying to get anyone on the phone at guest services. But we finally booked our trip on the website and decided a few days later to add a few things . When I called this time there was only a five minute wait. I had the pleasure of speaking to Sharon, she was not only helpful but she gave me tips, advice and was so pleasant. Sharon was so personable and a breath of fresh air. She helped me so much and I am so looking forward to this trip. I really wanted to do the survey after we spoke but we were disconnected. So here's my survey, Thank you Sharon.",Universal Studios Florida
Casey H,1.0," April 28, 2021",Not worth the stress or the money. Go to Disney instead.,"TLDR; They don’t observe or enforce Covid safety precautions and the limited park hours and long wait times make the trip a waste of time and money.  We went on April 26th and as soon as we walked up to the entrance, it was chaos. I wish I had taken a photo because I hadn’t seen a crowd like this since before Covid. I was shoulder to shoulder with unmasked strangers and did not see a single Universal employee in sight until we were at the main entrance to City Walk getting our temperature checked. At that point, the poor women checking temperatures were screaming at people to form a line. Everything in me was telling me to turn around and just ask for a refund, but I hoped it would get better once we got into the park.  Trying to get into the park wasn’t any easier, there were no guides to show us where to go and things were extremely backed up.  Once in the park, we figured we’d wait until wait times for Harry Potter rides went down and decided to ride some of the rides closer to the front of the park. The first line we get into was stress-inducing and made me want to leave right away. We begged people to observe the markings on the ground and keep a safe distance from us, but it wasn’t happening. People were taking their masks off in line when Universal employees were out of site (which I rarely even saw employees anyway) and even eating in line. We were unable to distance from the people in the lines to the left and right of where we stood and much preferred Disney’s plexiglass shields in these situations to Universals lack of dividers. It was loud (even for a musician that is hard of hearing) and the people in line with us were obnoxious and rude.  The whole reason we came to Universal was for Wizarding World of Harry Potter, but wait times were always over 75 minutes (or higher) and the Harry Potter parts of the park were always over crowded that we decided to keep our distance. It’s obvious they weren’t limited capacity. Everywhere we went, we were dodging people and trying to distance ourselves from others with no luck or reciprocated efforts.  After riding ONE Harry Potter ride (and not even the one we wanted to ride), we ended our day early and literally ran to the car to get out as fast as we could. Our experience was not worth the money for the ticket or the stress we endured throughout the park.  Honestly, we were shocked. Our experiences at the Disney parks were incredible as the staff went above and beyond to make sure Covid safety precautions were being followed and enforced. We never felt uncomfortable and rode every ride we wanted in every park with wait times under 45 minutes.",Universal Studios Florida
Pete O,1.0," April 26, 2021",Fast and Furious Supercharged,"This ride sucked. Completely lame. Over in about 2 mins. I get it, we were on a bus, not much you can do with it but the Kong ride is similar and 100% better. Do not waste your time even with a fast pass. And Vin Diesel is a horrible actor. :)",Universal Studios Florida
